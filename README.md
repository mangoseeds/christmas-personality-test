# Christmas MBTI Personality Test

This project creates a 12 question Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality test with a festive Christmas theme. Based on the user's responses, the test calculates the MBTI type and displays the result. The goal of this project was to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by building an interactive web app.

## How It Works

The user answers 12 questions choosing between two response options. Once all questions are answered, the responses are scored and used to determine the user's MBTI type. The MBTI consists of 4 personality dimensions:

Extroversion (E) vs Introversion (I)
Sensing (S) vs Intuition (N)
Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F)
Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P)
Each dimension has two opposing preferences which are combined into a 4-letter type. For example, ENFP is Extroverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Perceiving.

## Technologies Used

Let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements to this web app! I'm still learning web development and hope to build bigger projects from these foundational skills.
